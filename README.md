# CSE538-NLP-Project

## Requirements

Use python3.11.11 at least, with torch 2.6.0 and transformers 4.51.3. We experiment weird results under other versions

## Reproduction

You can try our final results with any of the lines inside run_experiments.sh

Intermediate files are generated by preprocess.py and translation.py, where the last take a considerable amount of time. Therefore we are leaving our generated file.
