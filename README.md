## Requirements

Use `python 3.11.11` at least, with `torch 2.6.0` and `transformers 4.51.3` or just run on Google Colab with A100 GPU. We experiment weird results under other versions.

We ran the code from a machine with Nvidia A100 80GB, cuda version 12.8.

## Reproduction

You can try our final results with any of the lines inside `run_experiments.sh`.

Intermediate files are generated by `preprocess.py` and `translation.py`, where the last take a considerable amount of time. Therefore we are leaving our generated file.

## File Description

`config.py`: Stores the config
`finetune.py`: Main part of the project, finetune and evaluate model
`gen_stat_data.py`: Generates statistics of data
`preprocess.py`: Combine the data into one JSON file
`translation.py`: Translates the texts in the combined data
`run_experiments.sh`: To run the experiment

The raw data and intermediate files can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CBQiP9hImIVqSsYWABEAAzxWPcc4d3UG/view?usp=share_link. Note: require CS email.

For the parts of the course, you can search `PART (number)`. For example `PART 1` will show the part where we did part 1 of the course.
